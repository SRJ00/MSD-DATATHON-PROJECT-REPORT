# MSD-DATATHON-PROJECT-REPORT

## The report is the final submission for the MSD Datathon 2023.

### Background
Substance abuse is a major problem in the United States, with an estimated 21.2 million
Americans aged 12 or older struggling with substance use disorder in 2020. Of those individuals,
only 4.2 million received any type of treatment for their addiction. There are a variety of
substance abuse treatment programs available throughout the country, including outpatient
counseling, residential treatment centers, and medication-assisted treatment. In 2021, there were
approximately 14,000 specialized substance abuse treatment facilities in the US, serving over 1.3
million people. However, there are still significant barriers to accessing treatment, including lack
of insurance coverage, stigma, and limited availability of services in certain areas. Despite these
challenges, substance abuse treatment programs remain a critical component of addressing the
ongoing addiction crisis in the United States.
Given this, your goal is to evaluate substance abuse treatment across specific states or even the
entire United States. You can evaluate them from any lens you want!
